Minor - A bird flies into the window of Charlie’s classroom however we see the bird flying towards the window beforehand which substantially reduces the impact

00:37:45 --> 00:37:50
Minor - We see a decapitated head on the road crawling with ants (not a jump scare but some viewers might find the image disturbing)

8
01:53:17 --> 01:53:22
